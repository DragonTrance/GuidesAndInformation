# Hello :)
This repository is a home for different kinds of guides and miscellaneous information that I'd like to share with people. The information is not organized, and I also don't fact-check my information, because I am my own source more often than not. Take this with a grain of salt, but I know what I believe is true or not, and these pages are the representation of my knowledge.
