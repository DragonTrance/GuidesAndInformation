# Hello :)
This repository is a home for different kinds of guides and miscellaneous information that I'd like to share with people. This information is not organized, and should also be taken with a grain of salt. I don't fact-check my information unless I have no idea what I'm talking about. Feel free to look up any concepts I discuss.

To find any new guides I create, I use the [Github Wiki Pages](https://github.com/DragonTrance/GuidesAndInformation/wiki). I edit all of these files in the browser, and updates will be live as soon as I make edits. I organize it to the best I can, but right now there's not much.

New images are uploaded in the [[files]] directory. You can look through here to scroll through the gallery we have, but they will probably always be on the wiki pages.
