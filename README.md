# Hello :)
This repository is a home for different kinds of guides and miscellaneous information that I'd like to share with people. This information is not organized, and should also be taken with a grain of salt. I don't fact-check my information unless I have no idea what I'm talking about. Feel free to look up any concepts I discuss.

To find new guides I create, take a look in [[_Directory]]. Their dates last-updated will be listed next to the subject. I'll try to organize it the best I can so you can find information you need the most, but right now there's not much.

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to edit my markdown files. If anything looks weird, that's my excuse. If you'd like, you can [download this repository](https://github.com/DragonTrance/GuidesAndInformation/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and view it with Obsidian. I think it's great.
