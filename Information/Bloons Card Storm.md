There's a few things that BCS (Bloons Card Storm) does not discuss in their tutorials. This is a small page that will discuss about useful information, and niche scenarios you could find yourself implanted into.
There will also be some information elaborated, even if the game talks about them. If you want to learn about BCS and expect to play it for a long time, this information is useful to start off with, but experience with these tidbits are also good.
